 # What I Did

In this assignment, I went ahead and made the page accessible to all. I started by adding alternative text to ALL images. Then I proceeded to make the HTML semantic and well organized, so that it would be easier to understand what is where and why. I also made sure to add everything in sequential order to format the page in a cleaner way. 

# Motivation and Why

I wanted to make sure this website was available to anyone and everyone. Everyone should be able to enjoy all the benefits of a website, so I wanted to make it inclusive.
